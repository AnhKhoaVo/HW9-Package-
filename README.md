For this homework 9, I found it relatively easier than the previous homework since I like to write own function. Thus, having to do a package allows me to explore that in depth. However, what I like to do and what I'm capble of are completely 2 different things.

In addition to the square and reciprocal functions in the Power package that we've done in class, I now included the box-cox transformation, the inverse box-cox transform, and a special feature for my package, which is a link function. 

Out of those new added functions, I found the link functions hard to comprehend, which alligns with my limited coding experience. I experienced more errors in my special features than my other functions in the package. I then had to dig up previous notes from STAT545, which I didn't take, for better comprehension. 

overall, I played it safe but I managed to complete the homework.
